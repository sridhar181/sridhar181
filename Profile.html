                            There are many algorithms out there which do not use Deep Learning methodology for Image 
                            Segmentation. The traditional methods include comparing pixels among each other. Those 
                            traditional methods cannot be customized for a specific purpose. Threshold based 
                            segmentation, Edge based segmentation , Clustering based segmentation are some of the methods 
                            that are already existing which do not use Neural Networks. The proposed system uses Neural networks for Image Segmentation. These methods can be 
                            customized for a specific purposes. R-CNN, Fast R-CNN and Faster R-CNN are compared and 
                            Faster R-CNN is picked for the implementation. Faster R-CNN works as unified model for image 
                            segmentation. This Faster R-CNN architecture consists of the RPN as a region proposal 
                            algorithm and the Fast R-CNN as a detector network.

                            The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model that could predict the maximum
                            sustained wind speed of tropical cyclones using satellite imagery.The CNN model was designed to take
                            grayscale satellite images as input and output a single continuous variable representing the predicted
                            wind speed.In summary, cyclone intensity estimation using CNN involves collecting and preprocessing satellite
                            images of cyclones, designing and training a CNN model to predict cyclone intensity, and evaluating
                            the model's performance on a held-out test set. The trained CNN model can then be deployed to estimate
                            the intensity of cyclones in real-time.The proposed approach provides a more accurate and reliable prediction of wind speed compared to the
                            existing system that relies on human observations from aircraft.
